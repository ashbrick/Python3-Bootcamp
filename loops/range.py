# RANGES
# range(7)      => gives you integers from 0 through 6 (count starts at 0 and is exclusive)
# range(1,8)    => will give you integers from 1 to 7 (two parameters are (start, end))
# range(1,10,2) => will give you odds from 1 to 10 (third param is called the "step", meaning how many to skip. Also which way to count, up + or down -)
# range(7,0,-1) => will give you integers from 7 to 1

# for num in range(10):
#     print(num)

# for num in range(0, 100, 5): # go from 0 - 99 in 5's 
#     print(num)

# for num in range(3,15,3):
#     print(num)

# for num in range(50,70):
#     print(num) # prints all numbers from 50-69
